# Creating a ZIP file for Netlify deployment

## Files to include in your ZIP

Include these essential files and folders:

- .next/ (entire build folder)
- public/ (static assets)
- package.json
- netlify.toml
- next.config.js

## Steps to create the ZIP using PowerShell

1. Open PowerShell and navigate to your project directory
2. Run this command to create the ZIP file:

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path .next, public, package.json, netlify.toml, next.config.js -DestinationPath netlify-deploy.zip
```

## Steps to deploy the ZIP to Netlify

1. Log in to your Netlify account (https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Go to "Sites" and click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop the netlify-deploy.zip file onto the upload area
4. Wait for the deployment to complete
5. Click on "Site settings" → "Build & deploy" → "Environment variables"
6. Add your environment variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: (your Supabase URL)
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: (your Supabase anonymous key)
7. Trigger a new deployment after adding environment variables
